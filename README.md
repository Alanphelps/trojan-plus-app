This is a project for bypass some firewalls in your mobile devices, it just supports [Trojan Plus](https://github.com/Trojan-Plus-Group/trojan-plus) and [original Trojan](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan), we don't have any plan to support other protocols such as Shadowsocks, V2ray and so on.

According we designing, all trojan plus mobile client should be in same UI with same user experience, that's why this project exists. Beside the core library [Trojan Plus](https://github.com/Trojan-Plus-Group/trojan-plus), we also use [Xamarin Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) to build this app including Android, iOS, UWP (Windows).
